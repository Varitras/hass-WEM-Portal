"""The CI matrix must test the Home Assistant releases it claims to test.

The "current HA" job installed the plugin unpinned, which reads like "newest
Home Assistant" but is not: the plugin ships a normal, non-prerelease version
for every Home Assistant BETA too, so pip resolved to one pinning
homeassistant==2026.8.0b3. Nothing then covered the release people actually
run, and the job stayed green while saying "current HA".

Only the selection logic is exercised here - no PyPI access, so this stays a
fast unit test rather than a network-dependent one.
