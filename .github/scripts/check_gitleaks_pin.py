"""Fail unless the gitleaks release the secret-scan workflow pins is the latest.

Dependabot follows `uses:` lines only. A release pinned in a `run:` step is
invisible to it, so the pin would age until somebody remembered - and drift
findings are exactly what "somebody will remember" produces. So check.sh asks
GitHub for the latest release instead and fails while the pin is behind,
printing the version and the asset digest the workflow needs, so the bump is
one edit. Needs the network; a check that cannot ask is a failure, not a pass.
